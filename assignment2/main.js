 * Use this file for all of the Javascript code you
 * write for Course Planner.
 *
 * Don't forget to include function-level comments
 * for each function!  They don't have to be too long;
 * just a short sentence is fine.  But, make sure you
 * capture the behavior, inputs and expected outputs
 * of your function in the comment.
